```bash
python -m venv venv 
```
**Step 4:** Run a virtual environment by running the following command:
```bash
 ./venv/Scripts/activate.ps1
```
**Step 5:** Run the following to command to install all necessary dependecies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  
**Step 6:** Start the program by running this command:

## Project Description
The project was created for the UBC Okanagan third year level course.

**Psych Bot's** goal is to give the user psychological advice*. This bot serves as an interactive conversational agent that takes the user's input (a sentence) and outputs an appropriate response. As this assignment does not require Machine Learning implementation, the chatbot may provide a reply that may not relate to the user's prompt.


*For **legal** reasons, neither the bot nor developers are certified to provide medical help.

## Unit Tests

### **For Windows**
&nbsp;

**Step 1:** Open your Powershell command line tool.

**Step 2:** To run the unit test in the Bot class run this command:
```bash
python tests/bot.test.py 
```
**Step 3:** To run the unit test in the FileReader class run this command:
```bash
python tests/fileReader.test.py
```
&nbsp;
### **For Unix Based Systems**
&nbsp;

**Step 1:** Open a terminal in your VSCode by going to ***Terminal > New Terminal*** 

**Step 2:** To run the unit test in the Bot class run this command:
```bash
python3 tests/bot.test.py
```
**Step 3:** To run the unit test in the FileReader class run this command:

## Dialogue

<img src="./docs/convo.gif" width="500" height="750">

### Error case 1 ###
In this case the bot does not understand the term "gang". The program has an issue with the response due to the limited capabilities of the library. The current word list in the library doesn't include enough dictionary to handle all possible words that user may provide to the bot. 

<img src="./docs/images/assign3error1.png">

### Error case 2 ###
In this case the bot does not correctly recoginize "goodd" as "good". This issue occurs due to the limitations of the library we are currently using - PorterStemmer. It has a limited data "object" of information on how to correctly "fix" the error unlike the larger companies(e.g., Google search).

## Assignment 3 New Features

### GUI ###
 
 <img src="./docs/images/GUI.PNG" width="300" height="500">

### Synonym Recognition ###

**>The bot is capable of detecting the synonyms of the words based on the user input**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Word : Family</td>
     <td>Word : Folk</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./docs/images/syn2.PNG" width="300" height="500"></td>
    <td><img src="./docs/images/syn1.PNG" width="300" height="500"></td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 
 ### POS Tagging ###
 
 **>Replying with a question or a therapy word (anxiety / depression / suicide) 
   Results in no more scheduled time**
   
 **>Replying with just a question 
   Results in the system not being able to help**
   
 **>Replying with anything else 
   Results in the system concluding the session**
 
 <table>
  <tr>
    <td>Question/Therapy words</td>
    <td>Just Question</td>
    <td>Other</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./docs/images/POS1.PNG" width="300" height="500"></td>
    <td><img src="./docs/images/POS2.PNG" width="300" height="500"></td>
    <td><img src="./docs/images/POS3.PNG" width="300" height="500"></td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 
 ### Sentiment Analysis ###
 
 **>the program determines if the user's response has a positive or negative context**
 
 <table>
  <tr>
    <td>Negative</td>
    <td>Positive</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./docs/images/SA1.PNG" width="300" height="500"></td>
    <td><img src="./docs/images/SA2.PNG" width="300" height="500"></td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 
 ## Data Flow Diagrams ##
 
 ### Data Flow Diagram level 0 ###

This is a level 0 data flow diagram. It shows the abstract relationships between the user, our graphical user inferface and the bot interact.

 ### Data Flow Diagram level 1 ###


This is a level 1 data flow diagram. It shows a more specific relationship between the user, our graphical user inferface and the bot. This includes the process in which the bot recieves data from the GUI, processes that data through the Porterstemmer as well as many language toolkits to improve the response.
